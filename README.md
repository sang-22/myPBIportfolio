CAR SALES DASHBOARD
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XYZ company is a car dealership that sells various car models. To
effectively track and analyse our sales performance, we need a comprehensive Car
Sales Dashboard in Power BI.
Objective: The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and
interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical
KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time
and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators
(KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable  to make informed decisions,
monitor the progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.
